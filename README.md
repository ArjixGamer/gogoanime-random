A userscript that adds a random button to gogoanime, that one feature we all wanted years now but didn't get.


The Python script is for generating ``all_anime.json`` that is going to be used by the userscript.
So you don't need to do anything with that, I'll maintain the ``all_anime.json`` myself.

To install the userscript head over to [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423703-gogorandom)
