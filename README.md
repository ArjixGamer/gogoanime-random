A userscript that adds a random button to gogoanime, that one feature we all wanted years now but didn't get.

The Python script is for generating ``all_anime.json`` that is going to be used by the userscript.
I have a workflow set up to update it every 5 days.

To install the userscript head over to [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423703-gogorandom)
